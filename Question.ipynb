        " •  ProductCategory: The category of the product (e.g., Electronics, Apparel, Grocery, etc.).\n",
        " •  Quantity: Number of units sold.\n",
        " •  Price: Unit price of the product.\n",
        " •  PaymentType: Payment method used (e.g., Cash, Credit, Debit).\n",
        " •  Discount: Discount applied (as a percentage, e.g., 10 for 10% discount). This column may have missing values if no discount was given.\n",

        "Your task is to perform the following analysis using Pandas only (do not use NumPy functions):\n",
        " 1. Data Loading & Parsing:\n",

        " •  Display the first 15 rows of the DataFrame.\n",
        " •  Print a summary (using methods like .info() and .describe()) to understand the structure and data types.\n",

        " •  Check for missing values in each column and print the count per column.\n",
        " •  For the columns Quantity, Price, and Discount, ensure they are in the correct numerical format.\n",
        " •  If Discount has missing values, assume a discount of 0% and fill those missing entries accordingly.\n",
